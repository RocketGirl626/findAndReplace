Title: findAndReplace
Description: A website where a user enters a string, chooses a word to find
and a word to replace it with.

Inputs/Output Examples:
Sample input: "The Cat in the Hat Comes Back!"
Find string: "Cat"
Replace string: "Alligator"
Output: "The Alligator in the Hat Comes Back!"

Testing:
Mocha/Chai is used to test the following:
1) That a string-type is returned.
2) That the substitution is successful (I couldn't think of any other tests
to do!)

User Interface:
The application uses BootStrap to style the page.  I was going to style it with
a 'Cat in the Hat' theme, but try as I might, I couldn't get my stylesheet
linked to the web page.

Known Issues:  Although the specs pass, the I can't get the results to display
on the web page.

Future Improvements:
1) Provide a fun user interface.
2) Create a madlibs version where you can replace words in the story.
